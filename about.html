    <h1>Sidney Stablein</h1>
    <p>I am a driven, attentive, and holistic designer who constantly seeks to learn
      more about design methods and trends. I believe art and business support and
      enhance each other. Looking at design from the perspective of the consumer
      has had a great impact on the way I think creatively. From working on my masters in 
      User Experience, personal projects, and working on the marketing team at Service
      Express I have learned strong analytical and User-Centered design skills to
      create design solutions that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.</p>
